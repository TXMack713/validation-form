The challenge
Users should be able to:

Enter their name, email address, and create a password in the submission form. The user should also be able to select their occupation and current state of residence from the provided drop-down menus. If necessary, the user should be able to reset the form if they create any mistakes when filling out the form.

My process
I started with the basic HTML form first and then after I was satisfied with the form setup, I proceeded to create the JavaScript logic to add an additional layer of protection for the email validity check.

I added the logic needed to populate the occupation and state drop-downs from the provided JSON object at https://frontend-take-home.fetchrewards.com/form.

To process the form data I googled examples of submitting the data using the Fetch API to refine and update my logic where necessary. Once the logic was added, I created the GitHub page necessary for real-world testing of my solution.

I also added barebones styling to the page to be able to highlight which fields contained data that was not properly formatted so that the user would be able to see which inputs did not conform to the form's requirements.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow

What I learned
I gained a better understanding of the Fetch API and FormData API and how to use them to create the JSON objects with the information entered by users through HTML forms.

Continued development
I'm continuing to progress through The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum as I work to gain a better understanding of the frontend and work to achieve mastery in my career.

Useful resources
The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com), MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and W3Schools (http://w3schools.com) has proved to be invaluable for quick lookups regarding the different values for certain properties and seeing them in action before implementing them.
